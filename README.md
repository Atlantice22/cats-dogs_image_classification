# cats-dogs_image_classification
(work in progress)

## General info
The theme of the project is to classify images of cats and dogs using a neural network. Since the project concerns image classification, specifically convolutional neural network is used. 

The dataset used is the Asirra dataset provided by Microsoft Research (25 000 images). It was divided into training and testing sets. The training set contains 24,900 images, including 12,450 images of dogs and 12,450 images of cats. The testing set contains only 40 images as around 60 images were found to be corrupted. 

## The tools & libraries:
- Google Colaboratory
- TensorFlow and Keras
- TensorBoard 
- numpy
- matplotlib
- opencv
- os
- tqdm
- pickle
- time

## Setup
(project is not finished yet)
